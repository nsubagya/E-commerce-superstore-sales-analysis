# E-commerce-superstore-sales-analysis
In this Power BI project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to address challenges in the retail and e-commerce sector. Leveraging my expertise, I meticulously pinpointed current and potential obstacles, showcased positive insights, and offered strategic solutions.

Utilizing Power BI, I conducted initial analyses, revealing robust sales but identified areas for profitability improvement. By delving deep into the data, I identified unprofitable customer segments and regions, along with specific products lagging in certain areas.

Based on these findings, I recommended strategic actions, including establishing new fulfillment centers, tailoring return/refund policies, and optimizing profit margins through strategic redistribution. Additionally, I proposed initiatives to combat nationwide furniture shrinkage and enhance customer appreciation based on profitability.

The project's success was attributed to dedicated data collectors laying a solid groundwork. The comprehensive three-page report provides detailed insights into the company's data terrain.

Excited to explore how these insights can drive your company's success!
